Based on the provided system description and database schema, here's the Python code for the service layer:

from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
In service/init.py, we load the environment variables from the .env file.

In service/image_service.py, we define an interface ImageDetailServiceInterface that declares the methods for creating an image, getting an image, getting all images, and getting an image content. We then define a class ImageDetailService that implements this interface. Each method in ImageDetailService calls the corresponding method in ImageRepository and handles any ValidationError that may be raised.

Here's a sample .env file:
# .env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=pixyproxy

Please note that the actual implementation of the methods in ImageDetailService is not provided as it requires specific SQL queries and logic that depends on your database schema and setup.
