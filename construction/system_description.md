The project at hand is the development of a Python FastAPI image generation service named PixyProxy, utilizing LLM technology. This service will later be integrated into a larger system called Ducky.

PixyProxy's primary function is to offer API endpoints that generate images from prompts. It also stores the metadata and content of these generated images. The service provides a list of image details and returns the image content. To ensure the system's functionality can be tested and graded, a specific API structure is agreed upon.

The API is divided into four main layers: database, service, core, and web.

The database layer, found in the /data directory, employs a repository pattern and uses MySQL. It is responsible for converting between models and dictionaries for efficiency and uses named parameters for SQL commands. The initialization logic is housed in an init.py module.

The service layer, located in the /service directory, manages requests. It revalidates incoming models from the web layer using pydantic. Any exceptions, whether they come from the database or service layer, are formatted as an ImageException.

The core layer, in the /core directory, concentrates on models and exceptions. All exceptions in this layer extend from ImageException.

The web layer, in the /web directory, contains separate resources for image management. It includes a dependency for universal logging of all requests.

The API offers various functionalities through its endpoints. These include generating an image (and image detail) from a prompt, retrieving details of a specific image, getting details of all images, and fetching an image file using a provided GUID. All responses from these endpoints are in JSON format.

The API also features universal request logging in a specific format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:min:sec,ms {{LoggingLevel}} {{request-id}} [thread-id] [method:line number] REQUEST START (or REQUEST END). The request-id is generated from the host-datetime-threadid. A single exception handler manages all exceptions.
