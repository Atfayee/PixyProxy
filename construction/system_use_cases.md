The selected text describes the system use cases for an image generation system named PixyProxy. Here's a brief explanation of each use case:

Create an Image: This use case involves generating a new image from a user-provided prompt (e.g., "generate a yellow duck for me"). The system generates a GUID, filename, and content detail for the image, storing them in the database. The system then returns an ImageDetail model object, which includes the prompt, filename, and GUID.

Get an Image: This use case involves retrieving the details of an image using a provided GUID. The system returns an ImageDetail model object, which includes the prompt, filename, and GUID.

Get All Images: This use case involves retrieving the details of all images stored in the database. The system returns a list of ImageDetail objects.

Get an Image Content: This use case involves retrieving the content of an image using a provided GUID. The system returns the image content as bytes in the body of the HTTP response.

The ImageDetail model object is defined using Pydantic, a Python library for data validation. The ImageDetailCreate class includes the prompt, and the ImageDetail class extends this to include the GUID and filename.
